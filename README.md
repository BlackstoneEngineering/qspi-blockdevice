# qspi-blockdevice
Block Device driver for Quad SPI in Mbed OS 5.9, must be used with feature-qpi branch of mbed-os

This is only to be used until mbed-os 5.10 is released in mid September 2018. As part of the 5.10 release this driver will be integrated into mbedos/features/filesystem/bd/quadspi and will be irrelevant as a standalone library.
